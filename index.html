<h1>Welcome To the Website About  Me, Coral</h1>
<h2> I am Coral, a freshman of Summit Shasta and in my life I've been
to Reno, Las Vegas, and Hong Kong.  I play basketball and loves to
take pictures. My favorite things are movies and sports and movies
are fun to watch and enjoy with my family and friends and sports 
are sometimes kindof competive which makes them fun to enjoy and 
play with all my friends.  When I was younger I was really into 
watching TV and when I got older, I started getting really into
basketball.  One of my  hobbies are playing basketball and going on
the internet to chat with my friends.  Since me and my old friends
don't go to the same  school anymore, we chat a lot when we get home
and open up the social media sights and I've always liked playing
basketball so sometimes when there's not much to do I go out and 
play for a while or until I'm tired.  Talking on social media and 
doing video chats are mainly what I do when I chat with my friends 
because we don't each other as much as we used to when we went to 
the same school.
